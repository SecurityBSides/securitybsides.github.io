{/* you can import libraries whenever you need, or at the head (per JSX standard) */}
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome";
import { faMastodon, faTwitter } from "@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons";
import { Link } from "gatsby";

This header was automatically included, no need to make your own.
It's built from the eventName and eventYear a the top of your event entry.
See below for more details.

## Writing Content

Content is created by making an mdx (markdown + jsx) file in `src/events` with the right headers.
Conventionally, we'd like to have a directory for each event with a subdirectory for the year.
You can view this example event file(s) in the repo, to look at the source
while reading through this, or as a reference to copy for setting up your own event.

<a
   href="https://github.com/SecurityBSides/securitybsides.github.io/blob/main/src/events/BSides%20Example/BSides%20Example%20Event%202024.mdx"
   target="_blank"
>
   `src/events/BSides Example/2024`
</a>

To have an event automatically included, you need to have the following at the top of your file (frontmatter):

```yaml
---
eventName: "BSides Example"
eventYear: 2024
eventDate: 2024-12-31
---
```

-  triple hyphens before and after - this separates the frontmatter from the page content, and is mandatory (or your file will be ignored)
-  eventName - sets the name for your event
   -  examples: `BSidesSF` or `BSidesLV` or `BSides Krak√≥w`
-  eventDate - Date of our event, or the start date.
   -  This must be a single day (will be used in date comparisons for sorting)
   -  This must be a Javascript parseable date format, otherwise the field will be null
-  eventYear - Necessary for the year in the path
   -  Yes, this is duplicate information.
   -  We're working on figuring a way to compute this from eventDate

Once that is done, you can write your content in JSX or Markdown, and you can intertwine them.

-  external links should use `<a>` tags, with target set to `_blank`
-  see the page on including images to see examples of imports and ways

The following icons are included via JSX (we are already including FontAwesomeIcon)

   <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faMastodon} size="xl" />

<Link href="https://twitter.com/securitybsides" target="_blank">
   <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTwitter} size="xl" />
