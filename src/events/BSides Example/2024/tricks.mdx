#### Using Images

{/* path in this event, can also be ../images for images used in all BSides Example events */}
{/* or ./images/ if you want to keep images in a subdirectory here */}
import bsidesLogo from "./bsides_logo.png";

{/* if you want to pull from the site images, you can reference by path */}
{/* though I think there might be a cleaner way to magic this. */}
import bsidesCommonLogo from "../../../images/bsides_logo.png";

Or a similar method to include images (these are from 2 different sources)

```markdown
import bsidesLogo from "./bsides_logo.png";
import bsidesCommonLogo from "../../../images/bsides_logo.png";

<img src={bsidesLogo} />
<img src={bsidesCommonLogo} />
![BSides logo](./bsides_logo.png)
```

<img src={bsidesLogo} alt="BSides logo" />
<img src={bsidesCommonLogo} alt="BSides logo" />
![BSides logo](./bsides_logo.png)

Generally, please do not hard code a path into a tag, it will fail silently and we want errors to be loud.
We are still in heavy development and things may move around, so if we do move something you rely on, we want
to know asap so we can make a fix.

<hr />
#### Adding pages to your event

In the frontmatter at the top of the page, include a new field:

`eventPage`

-  this will go through some weird slugification, so keep it simple and the slugification will also be simple
-  notice this page has an 'eventPage' of "Tricks" but the url path is "tricks", slugification makes everything lower case
-  this is appended to the page title, without going through slugification

Once you have this set, you can use `Link` from Gatsby to provide navigation between your pages. This is how we have
the pages for the example set up:

```jsx
import {Link} from "gatsby";

<Link to={".."}> Main </Link>
<Link to={"../page3"}>Page 3</Link>
```

**NOTE:** If you don't know where something is, if you are running the develop server and go to a non-existent page, it
will show you all the available paths which might help you find the page(s) you're creating.

<hr />
#### Adding comments

You might think one of the standard forms of comments for Javascript will work. // and /_ say that you're wrong :)
For comments in mdx files you wrap a single line with `{/_ Your comment here \*/}`

<hr />
import {Link} from "gatsby";

<ul>
   <li>
      <Link to={".."}>Event Page</Link>
   </li>
   <li>
      <Link to={"../problems"}>Known Problems</Link>
   </li>
</ul>
