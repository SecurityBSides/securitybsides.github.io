#### Known issues

-  Markdown is classic markdown which does not have the extra sauce from Github Flavored Markdown, we're working on it.
-  We don't have a "verify" page yet, so you can check the path of the file(s) you've added against what we expect.
-  The live-reloading development server sometimes doesn't update the cache well. When this happens it's best to restart it after `yarn run clean`
-  "SyntaxError" after a minor change? Did you add an `import` or remove blank lines? For some Javascript, it needs a blank line before non-javascript content
