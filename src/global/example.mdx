This is an example page in the global space. Currently this is needed so graphql will find the right headings.

Once we have real content, a lot of this should be moved into a README or CONTRIBUTING.

To create a new page in the global space, put it in `/global` and use the following fields for frontmatter:

```yaml
globalPage: Page Name
nav:
   head: NavHeading
   test: Link text
   priority: Importance / Sorting
```

-  GlobalPage is what triggers this to be created by `{mdx.frontmatter__globalPage}.jsx` in `/pages`.
-  nav is a heading or navigation information, where should this page be added to the navigation bar
-  head indicates which heading to add this page under. Right now the pre-defined options are:
   -  General - General Articles
   -  Contact - Ways of contact
   -  How To - Instructions
-  text is what will be displayed for the link text.
-  priority specifies how far up the list it should be placed. Items of equal priority will not have a guaranteed order.
